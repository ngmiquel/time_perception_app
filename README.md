# time_perception_app
I developed this app for my final degree thesis on time perception and physical activity. I wanted to explore how time perception could be altered by high-intensity physical activity.
It is a fairly simple app with various functionalities such ass add/remove participants, connectivity to Bluetooth heart rate monitors, and some basic data management.
It is worth noting that I did not code this app by myself, I relied on the latest ChatGPT programming models in order to help me code some of the functions.
